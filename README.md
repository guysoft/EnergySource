Work in progress, game jam entry for Go Godot 2.

This is a rhythm game that works in vr using OpenXR, and supports WebXR.
It has a cool mechanic where you can slow down the music inside a level.

## Developer setup
Import the godot project and install the following addons:
* godot-openxr

## Developer settings
In order to run in non-vr mode for debugging set ``ENABLE_VR`` to ``false`` in ``scripts/GameVariables.gd``
